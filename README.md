Loading shared (C) libraries resembling theories using a python script.
In this way we can use difference logic (clingoDL), CSP(clingcon) and other theories in combination with the
clingo Python api,
enabling easy multi-shot solving with theories and also maybe theory
combinations.


Note that this requires Python 3 to run (the theory module uses type
annotations).
